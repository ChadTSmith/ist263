    Hello! My name is Chad Smith and I am a computer science major. Currently I am interested in backend work pertaining to server and database design

	Currently I am proficient in Java, Python, C, and C++
	Have work experience with a Fortune 500 company in the field of computer science
	Trying to get my Masters Degree in 5 Years

My greatest hobby outside of school is traveling across the globe. Over the break I was able to go on a cruise to many different islands in the Caribbean. Iâ€™ve been to many countries throughout my life such as England, China, Russia, France, Japan, many countries in Africa, and many more places across the globe!


Hope to have a fantastic semester!
