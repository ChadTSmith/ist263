                During the summer of 2023 I had the pleasure of working with a professor on a summer research project 
                detailing if Artificial Intelligence can be used to construct mathematical proofs. During that time I 
                researched and became acquainted with A.I tools such as TensorFlow to see if an A.I can guess the next 
                step in a proof when given a database of proofs. If successful this can drastically decrease the potential 
                overhead of proof creation as Artificial Intelligence would be much more adept at applying the millions 
                of proof concepts to a given problem, compared to a human. This project also gave me experience in 
                Debugging Python code which was primarily used to gather information about the proofs. In the end our 
                professor was able to create a research paper about the project but unfortunately was not accepted in 
                the publishing process. Either way the project granted me an incredible amount of experience in the 
                field of Artificial Intelligence that I may end up using in a future career path.</p>

                    During the summer of 2024 I got hired at FactSet for an opportunity to work on a software engineering 
                    project to assist an industry level Scrum team! My project for that summer involved creating a Java 
                    Mock Data Server that can seamlessly integrate into the API that our team created. This server allows 
                    clients to input their own data into an XML file and the server would return that data back to them, 
                    imitating the service of the main server. This purpose of the Mock Server was to potentially be packaged 
                    alongside the API such that we can give a demo of the main server to potential buyers. I thoroughly 

                    enjoyed this project as it gave me experience with industry level GitHub practices as well as experience 
                    working with a Scrum Team. Thanks to the guidance of my fellow teammates as well as my Java ability, I 
                    was able to finish the project in time for the internshipâ€™s end. I hope to do some more great work when I 
                    return there for this summer!
