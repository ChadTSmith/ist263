                This picture was from a hot air balloon ride in Africa. I chose the picture because it best 
                encapsulated my feelings about that trip as a whole. The trip mainly comprised of animal safaris as 
                well as sightseeing on the open savannahs of Africa. Being able to see Lions, Giraffes and 
                Wildebeests in their own natural habitat was surreal to see and is by far one of the best experiences 
                I have ever had in my youth. The hot air balloon ride was especially special since it gave me the 
                opportunity to see all of the animals from a birds-eye view with the sunrise in the distance. This is 
                absolutely an experience that I will never forget.</p>-->

                This picture was from my most recent travel experience, a cruise on Queen Mary 2 around the 
                islands of the Caribbean. I really enjoyed staying on the beach and touring around the many islands 
                such as St Martin and St Kitz. I am looking forward to going back in the future!

                This picture was taken when I was on a trip to Japan many years back. As you can see in the picture, I ended up going in the spring based on the Cherry Blossoms in bloom. During this trip I was 
                able to go to many of the excursions in Akihabara as well as go to famous landmarks such as Mt. 
                Fuji. I especially enjoyed the dining experience as there were many tasty restaurants in the area I 
                ended up going to. Overall an extremely pleasant experience that I think fondly of every day
